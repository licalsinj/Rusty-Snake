## Gameplay

Control the snake with the arrow keys (or WASD) to eat the apple.
Avoid the walls and running over your own tail.
End the game by pressing Escape.

## Know Issues

~~if you press any key other than the arrow keys or WASD.~~

## Potential Improvements

Instead of auto restarting wait for the user to press space to restart.
Keep track of the score and display it during the game and at the end.
Add the ability to pause the game.
